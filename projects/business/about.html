Our efforts in sustainability as an organization reflect our commitment to the idea that our children and grandchildren will have a wonderful natural environment to explore throughout their lives. Our role as a company is to ensure that we’re giving back more to the communities and the natural surroundings that we help you to visit than what is being taken away in our travels. Preserving cultural heritage and conserving and replenishing the natural environment, while improving the lives of local people, is the essence of our way of travelling and is integrated into every decision and action we take at Nepal Adventures.</p>

By offering adventure-craving travellers an alternative to the resorts and cruises they were accustomed to, he not only changed the way people looked at their holiday time, but changed the face of travel forever. More than 28 Days later, the only thing that hasn’t changed is an inherent belief in the core values that continue to inspire our being and business today.</p>
